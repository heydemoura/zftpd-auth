## Repository architecture

The C code is split into responsibility-based modules (`ftp`, `http`, `transfer`,
`archive`, `runtime`, `platform`, and `app`) rather than a flat `src/`/`include/`
namespace. Generated assets live under `build/`, not in the source tree. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the dependency rules and layout.

## Overview

`zftpd` is a high-performance FTP server written in C11. It was designed around a single idea: **the data path should be as fast as the hardware allows**, with no unnecessary work anywhere between file and socket.

In practice, this means using `sendfile` where the OS supports it, keeping the hot path free of allocations, and handling TCP backpressure correctly so the pipe never stalls under load. The result is an FTP daemon that **saturates a full Gigabit Ethernet link** in both directions — on Linux, macOS, or any POSIX-compliant system — without any client-side tuning.

The same binary model also targets PS4 and PS5 as console payloads, with on-screen notifications and an optional browser-based file explorer. This is an extension of the same codebase, not a fork — the POSIX foundation is identical.

```
Philosophy
  ├── Keep the data path fast          →  sendfile fast path, zero-copy where available
  ├── Handle TCP correctly             →  partial sends, EINTR, backpressure-aware buffers
  ├── Stay portable                    →  C11, POSIX, standard toolchain
  ├── Be predictable under load        →  no dynamic allocation per transfer, no surprises
  └── Extras are opt-in               →  encryption, rate limiting, web UI — all compile-time
```

---

## ⚡ Performance

> `zftpd` saturates a full Gigabit Ethernet link — **~117 MB/s sustained** in both directions.

This is the physical ceiling of a 1 GbE connection. It is achieved out of the box, with no kernel tuning required.

```
  Benchmark — single stream, wired 1 GbE, plain transfer

  Download  ████████████████████████████████████████████  117 MB/s
  Upload    █████████████████████████████████████████     108 MB/s
                                                          ────────
  Physical ceiling (1 GbE)                                125 MB/s
```

**What makes it fast:**

| Technique | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sendfile` kernel fast path | Moves file data directly to the socket — zero userspace copies |
| Partial-send loop | Handles short writes without stalling or corrupting the stream |
| EINTR-safe I/O | Signal interrupts are absorbed cleanly in the hot loop |
| Allocation-free transfer path | No `malloc`, no locking per packet or per transfer |
| Token-bucket limiter is opt-in | Adds zero overhead when rate limiting is not needed |

> **On encryption:** enabling `AUTH XCRYPT` (ChaCha20) disables `sendfile` and switches to buffered I/O. Throughput becomes CPU-bound. For maximum speed on a trusted network, use plain transfers — that is what `sendfile` is there for.

## 🛠 Best Setup

### Network — wired is the only choice

`zftpd` performs at the physical limit of your network. The bottleneck is almost always the medium, not the software. **Wi-Fi is the bottleneck** — even Wi-Fi 6 introduces retransmissions and variable latency that collapse sustained FTP throughput. Use a wired connection.

The optimal topology is a direct Ethernet cable between source and destination, eliminating every unnecessary hop:

```
  [Source machine]
        │
  Ethernet cable
        │
  [Destination machine]
```

If a switch is needed, any Gigabit switch works. Avoid powerline adapters and MoCA bridges — they introduce jitter that disrupts sustained transfers.

**Assign static IPs on both ends** (e.g. `192.168.100.1` / `192.168.100.2`). This removes DHCP latency and keeps the setup fully deterministic.

---

### FTP clients

| Client | Platform | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **FileZilla** | Windows · macOS · Linux | Best general-purpose choice. Enable parallel transfers for directory trees. |
| **WinSCP** | Windows | Excellent throughput and error recovery. |
| **lftp** | Linux · macOS | Best CLI option. `pget -n 4` enables parallel chunked downloads. |
| **Cyberduck** | macOS · Windows | Solid for occasional transfers. |
| OS built-in FTP | any | ❌ Avoid — artificially capped speeds, no resume support. |

**Things that matter on the client side:**

- **Transfer mode must be Binary** (`TYPE I`). `zftpd` defaults to Binary, but a misconfigured client can override this silently — always verify.
- **Use passive mode** (`PASV`). It's the default and works cleanly behind NAT and firewalls. Active mode requires the server to reach back to the client and is frequently blocked.
- **Enable parallel connections** for large directory trees. FileZilla exposes this under Site Manager → Transfer Settings. It will not increase single-file speed, but dramatically reduces total time for many small files.
- **Disable client-side CRC or integrity checks** if offered. TCP guarantees delivery; checksumming again adds latency for no benefit.

---

### Linux — optional kernel tuning

`zftpd` reaches full Gigabit speed with default kernel parameters. If you are feeding a very fast NVMe drive into the network and want to raise the ceiling further:

```bash
# Raise socket buffer limits — run as root, optional
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=134217728
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=134217728
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="4096 87380 134217728"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="4096 65536 134217728"
```

To make these persistent, add them to `/etc/sysctl.conf`.

<details>
<summary><b>PS4 / PS5 — console-specific notes</b></summary>

<br/>

- `zftpd` requires a payload loader to run on console (WebKit / PPPwn / GoldHEN on PS4; etaHEN or equivalent on PS5). The daemon itself does not require a resident HEN.
- Launch after the system is fully booted and the loader is ready. The on-screen notification will display the IP and port.
- For maximum throughput: direct cable from console to PC, static IPs, no router in between.
- Avoid initiating transfers while background downloads or system updates are active — the network stack is shared.
- If you see **"payload already loaded"**: a previous instance is still active. The new payload asks it to shut down on its control port (`127.0.0.1:28888`) and the previous instance runs its own teardown even when its threads are blocked, so it always releases the FTP, HTTP and MCP ports. Instances that predate the control port — or one wedged after accepting it — are identified by thread name and stopped, never signalling the loader's process group. If a payload still holds the console, the new instance stops instead of binding ports another instance owns.

<details>
<summary><b>PS5 — firmware-dependent transfer speed</b></summary>

<br/>

Transfer speed to the **internal storage** (`/data/...`) varies significantly across PS5 firmware versions. This is **not** a `zftpd` limitation — it is caused by Sony's kernel-level I/O driver improvements across firmware updates.

```
  Upload speed to internal storage (wired 1 GbE, measured across multiple consoles)

  FW  4.03   ████████                                      ~20 MB/s
  FW  8.60   ████████████████████                           ~50 MB/s
  FW  9.00   ██████████████████████████████████              ~85 MB/s
  FW 10.00   ████████████████████████████████████████████   ~113 MB/s
                                                             ────────
  Physical ceiling (1 GbE)                                   125 MB/s
```

**Why it happens:**
- The PS5 internal storage uses the PFS (PlayStation File System) with mandatory block-level encryption. Every `write()` syscall goes through the kernel's crypto + NVMe pipeline.
- Sony has incrementally improved this pipeline (write scheduling, page cache, NVMe queue depth) across firmware releases. On FW 10.00 the kernel saturates Gigabit.
- This is **not** related to PFS crypto cost alone — if it were, speeds would be constant across all firmware. The scaling pattern proves the bottleneck is kernel I/O scheduling, not encryption.

**External USB storage** (`/mnt/usb0/...`, typically exFAT) bypasses PFS entirely and consistently reaches **~113 MB/s** regardless of firmware version.

**What this means for users:**
- On older firmware (< 9.00), internal storage writes are kernel-limited. No FTP server (zftpd, ftpsrv, GoldHEN) can exceed these speeds — the limit is in the OS.
- For maximum speed on older firmware, transfer to **external USB-C storage** instead.
- On FW 9.00+ the internal storage speed approaches Gigabit saturation.

## 📦 Build & commands

**Make targets (host auto-detection, best-effort toolchains):**

- `make` — build default target (Linux on Linux host, macOS on macOS host) release.
- `make release-all` — release build per platform detected (macos, linux, ps3, ps4, ps5).
- `make debug-all` — debug build per platform detected.
- `make release-matrix` — release build per platform *and* variant `ENABLE_ZHTTPD=0/1`, producing ELF/BIN dove applicabile.
- `make TARGET=<platform> BUILD_TYPE=<release|debug> [ENABLE_ZHTTPD=0|1] clean all` — build singolo.

**Useful Makefile variables:**

- `TARGET`: `linux`, `macos`, `ps3`, `ps4`, `ps5` (auto su host). Case-insensitive.
- `BUILD_TYPE`: `release` (default), `debug`.
- `ENABLE_ZHTTPD`: `1` abilita web UI zhttp (default 0 su console, 1 su PC). Influenza naming: es. `zftpd-ps5-zhttp-v1.3.0.bin`.
- `ARTIFACT_PREFIX`: prefisso binari (default `zftpd`).
- `ffi_langs`: opzionale, per build dei binding FFI.

**Output naming (release):**
- ELF: `build/<target>/release[/ -zhttp]/zftpd-<platform-tag>[-zhttp]-v<version>.elf`
- BIN (console): `... .bin`

**Execution (binaries host):**

```
./build/macos/release/zftpd-macos-$(uname -m)-v1.3.0 -p <port> -d <root>
./build/linux/release/zftpd-linux-$(uname -m)-v1.3.0.elf -p <port> -d <root>
```

Supported options:
- `-p <PORT>`  (default 2121)
- `-d <DIR>`   root FTP
- `-h`         help

## 📦 Build

Output artifacts are versioned and platform-tagged, placed in `build/<target>/<build_type>/`.

### Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Compiler | C11 — `gcc` or `clang` |
| Build system | `make` |
| `.bin` generation | `objcopy` (binutils or llvm-objcopy); PS4: `orbis-objcopy`; PS5: `prospero-objcopy` |
| PS4 | `PS4_PAYLOAD_SDK` set in environment; zhttp builds with downloads use the PacBrew PS4 portlibs, installed by `tools/fetch_pacbrew_ps4.sh` |
| PS5 | `PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK` set in environment; zhttp builds require the PacBrew SDK bundle with libcurl + libnfs |

### Commands

```bash
# Targets
make TARGET=linux
make TARGET=macos
make TARGET=ps4
make TARGET=ps5

# Modifiers
make TARGET=linux BUILD_TYPE=debug
make TARGET=linux ENABLE_ZHTTPD=1     # enable web UI (off by default on POSIX)
make TARGET=ps5   ENABLE_ZHTTPD=0     # disable web UI (on by default on console)

# Tests (POSIX only)
make TARGET=linux test
make TARGET=macos test
```

### Console web downloads

PS4 and PS5 zhttp builds use the maintained PacBrew ports of **libcurl**
(PS5 also **libnfs**). The downloader supports HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/FTPS and
`nfs://` NAS sources; HTTPS certificate verification stays enabled and the
PacBrew Mozilla CA bundle is embedded into the payload at build time.
See [`docs/dependencies.md`](docs/dependencies.md).

PS5 zhttp releases also accept `magnet:?` links. They use a native
libtorrent-rasterbar engine inside the payload; no companion computer is
required. For local PS5 builds, install a PS5 SDK, then run
`bash tools/build_ps5_libtorrent.sh "$PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK"` followed by
`make TARGET=ps5 ENABLE_LIBTORRENT=1 clean all`. The release workflow builds this
dependency automatically.

PS5 extracts ZIP archives with its built-in reader. To enable other formats
supported by libarchive, install PacBrew `ps5-payload-libarchive` in the PS5
SDK and build with `make TARGET=ps5 ENABLE_LIBARCHIVE=1`. ZIP files continue
to use the built-in reader in that build.

PS4 builds detect the PacBrew package through the target toolchain only
(`orbis-pkg-config` / `orbis-curl-config` inside `PS4_PAYLOAD_SDK`, or the
`OPENORBIS` environment), never through the host's libcurl. When the package
is missing the downloader is disabled at build time and the rest of zftpd is
unaffected; the same behaviour is available explicitly with
`ENABLE_LIBCURL=0`. Override `PS4_PKG_CONFIG`, `PS4_CURL_CONFIG` and
`PS4_CA_BUNDLE` to point at a custom install.

#### Download queue and resume

Links pasted into the Transfers view line up in a FIFO queue: `TRANSFER_MAX_CONCURRENT`
downloads run at a time (2 by default, override at build time with
`-DTRANSFER_MAX_CONCURRENT=<n>`) and the rest wait, showing their position.
Queued jobs can be held back or cancelled before they ever start; up to
`TRANSFER_MAX_ACTIVE` (16) jobs are tracked.

HTTP/FTP/NFS downloads write to `<name>.zftpd.part` and rename it after
`fsync()`. Magnet downloads write a `<name>.zftpd.part` directory containing
the torrent files; the directory is renamed after every piece is verified.
Download status, destination and progress are recorded
atomically in `/data/zftpd/transfers.state` (falling back to `/tmp/zftpd/`).
BitTorrent resume data is stored alongside that state file. On startup zftpd
restores the visible list and resumes unfinished jobs from the bytes already
on disk. Paused jobs stay paused, and failed
jobs remain visible for retry. The Transfers view can delete a saved partial
and its record, or use Start over to delete it and start the same link from
zero. Removing a completed record leaves the completed file untouched.

### Artifacts

| Platform | Output |
|---|---|
| Linux | `build/linux/release/zftpd-linux-<arch>-v<ver>.elf` |
| macOS | `build/macos/release/zftpd-macos-<arch>-v<ver>` |
| PS4 | `zftpd-ps4-v<ver>.bin` · `zftpd-ps4-v<ver>.elf` |
| PS5 | `zftpd-ps5-v<ver>.bin` · `zftpd-ps5-v<ver>.elf` |

---

## 🚀 Running

### Linux

```bash
./build/linux/release/zftpd-linux-<arch>-v<version>.elf [-p <port>] [-d <root>]
```

### macOS

```bash
./build/macos/release/zftpd-macos-<arch>-v<version> [-p <port>] [-d <root>]
```

### Docker (Linux)

A multi-stage [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) builds the zhttp variant into a small
Debian image, and [`docker-compose.yaml`](docker-compose.yaml) wires up the
ports, the files volume, the persisted web state and every environment variable:

```bash
cp -n /dev/null .env            # optional: ZFTPD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=..., ZFTPD_FILES=/srv/files, ZFTPD_UID=$(id -u)
docker compose up -d --build    # FTP on 2121, web interface on http://<host>:8888
```

The service uses host networking because FTP passive mode opens a random data
port per transfer, which cannot be published through Docker's NAT; for a
web-only deployment switch to the commented `ports:` block instead.

### PS4

Send `.bin` to your payload loader, or `.elf` if the loader accepts ELF directly.  
On startup: on-screen notification displays IP and port.

### PS5

Send `.bin` or `.elf` depending on your loader.  
On startup: `FTP: <ip>:<port>` notification.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configuration is compile-time, in [`include/ftp/ftp_config.h`](include/ftp/ftp_config.h).

| Macro | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `FTP_DEFAULT_PORT` | `2121` (POSIX) · `2120` (console) | Listening port |
| `FTP_MAX_SESSIONS` | — | Maximum concurrent client sessions |
| `FTP_SESSION_TIMEOUT` | — | Idle session timeout |
| `FTP_TRANSFER_RATE_LIMIT_BPS` | *disabled* | Token-bucket average rate cap |
| `FTP_TRANSFER_RATE_BURST_BYTES` | *disabled* | Token-bucket burst allowance |
| `FTP_LOG_COMMANDS` | — | Log every received command |

### Web interface login (environment)

The web interface can require a login. It is **off** unless configured; the
settings are read from the environment when the daemon starts:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ZFTPD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *unset* | Turns the login gate on and creates (or resets) the administrator account |
| `ZFTPD_ADMIN_USER` | `admin` | Login name of that administrator |
| `ZFTPD_HTTP_AUTH` | *auto* | `0` forces the gate off, `1` forces it on. Unset: on whenever an administrator exists |
| `ZFTPD_HTTP_SESSION_TTL` | `604800` | Session lifetime in seconds (7 days) |
| `ZFTPD_STATE_DIR` | `/data/zftpd`, then `/tmp/zftpd` | Where accounts, folder rules and share links are stored |

```bash
ZFTPD_ADMIN_PASSWORD='change-me' ./zftpd-linux-x86_64-zhttp-v1.6.0.elf -d /srv/files
```

Accounts, folder rules and share links are persisted, so once an
administrator exists the gate stays on across restarts even without the
variable; set `ZFTPD_HTTP_AUTH=0` to open the interface again.

---

## 🌐 ZHTTP

ZHTTP is a lightweight HTTP server embedded in `zftpd` that serves a browser-based file explorer. It allows browsing, downloading, and optionally uploading files from any browser on the local network — no FTP client required.

| Target | Default | To override |
|---|---|---|
| PS4 / PS5 | ✅ on | `make TARGET=ps5 ENABLE_ZHTTPD=0` |
| Linux / macOS | ❌ off | `make TARGET=linux ENABLE_ZHTTPD=1` |

Once the daemon is running, open `http://<ip>:<port>/` — the HTTP port mirrors the configured FTP port.

Upload support is enabled automatically alongside ZHTTP (`ENABLE_WEB_UPLOAD=1`).

> **Security:** by default ZHTTP has no authentication beyond network access and is designed for local-network use. Start the daemon with `ZFTPD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` set to require a login (see [Configuration](#️-configuration)). Even then, do not expose it on a public interface: it speaks plain HTTP.

### Accounts, roles and shared folders

With the login gate on, every page and API call needs a session (cookie, or `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for scripts). Two roles exist:

| Role | Can do |
|---|---|
| **Administrator** | Everything: files, transfers, games, system, share links, user management |
| **User** | Browse, download, upload and edit files **only inside the folders an administrator allowed** (*Settings → Folders for users*). No share links, no system or console features |

Administrators manage accounts under *Settings → Users*; each account is just a login and a password. The administrator created from the environment can add more administrators from there.

### Share links

Any file or folder can be shared with people who have no account: select it in Files and choose **Share…** (or right-click a folder background → *Share this folder…*). A share link looks like `http://<ip>:<port>/s/<id>`:

- a **file** link downloads the file directly (resumable, works with `curl`/`wget`);
- a **folder** link opens a plain page where the folder can be browsed, each file downloaded, and the whole folder fetched as a ZIP (`…?zip=1`).

Links can expire after a chosen delay or on a given date, or never expire. The **Shares** view lists every link with its expiry, copies or opens it, and removes it; expired links answer `410 Gone` until purged. Only administrators create and manage shares.

After console Rest Mode, ZHTTP auto-reconnects via `/api/status` (see [docs/restmode.md](docs/restmode.md)).

Custom console toasts are available via `GET /api/notify?text=Hello` (useful for Home Assistant and similar local automation — see [docs/API.md](docs/API.md)).

The System view also drives the hardware: fan threshold, network-listener restart and **Blu-ray eject** (`POST /api/system/eject`, hidden on Digital Edition consoles). The eject path comes from [BD-EJ](https://github.com/seregonwar/BD-EJ).

Downloads and previews send the raw file bytes. Console **SELF containers** can be requested decrypted instead, exactly like the FTP path does: enable *Settings → Downloads → Decrypt protected files* (or pass `?decrypt=1` to `/api/file/get`). The kernel pager is swapped in for that transfer only, so every other file — and every other client — keeps getting the on-disk bytes untouched.

Selecting many items (folders included) offers **Download as ZIP**: the archive is built *while* it streams (`/api/archive/zip`), so nothing is written to the console and even multi-gigabyte selections need no free space.
